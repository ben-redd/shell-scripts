### This is a folder containing scripts I've written for running various terminal commands to make my life easier

To get these commands running on your machine follow these steps

1. Create a symlink to your script:
   `sudo ln -s /full/path/to/your/file /usr/local/bin/name_of_new_command`
2. Make your file executable:
   `chmod +x /full/path/to/your/file`
3. Now you should be able to run name_of_new_command at any time in your terminal.
